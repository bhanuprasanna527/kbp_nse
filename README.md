# kbp_nse

kbp_nse is a Python library for getting stock data with more features. We use this library to get stock data from National Stock Exchange (NSE) which is present in India. It is one of the Largest Stock exchanges present in the World.

Let us take a look at How we can get the Stock Data? Let us see what normal stock data with fewer features look like:

| Date | Open | Close | High | Low | Volume |
|------|------|-------|------|-----|--------|
